# Pokedex react native V2
This repository is the continuation of this repository
https://github.com/YuenEsc/pokedex

Also I took assets and color palette from this repository built with flutter and I tried to mix both the hooks of my previous repository and the UI implementation on Flutter of this repo as this repository of flutter has JSON data instead of fetch an API

The original design belongs to [Saepul Nahwan](https://dribbble.com/saepulnahwan23)


## Goal improvements over the other version

 - [ ] Cleaner code
 - [ ] More performance
 - [ ] Separate business logic from UI
 - [ ] Almost vanilla components [Less dependencies] 

## Progress screenshots
I will try to update a screenshot folder with the progress I have done
