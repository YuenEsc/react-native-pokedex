# Pokedex react native V2
This repository is the continuation of this repository
https://github.com/YuenEsc/pokedex

Also I took assets and color palette from this repository built with flutter and I tried to mix both the hooks of my previous repository and the UI implementation on Flutter of this repo as this repository of flutter has JSON data instead of fetch an API
